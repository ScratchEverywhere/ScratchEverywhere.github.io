# Installation

Scratch Everywhere! is Homebrew software and requires a hacked/modded console.
There are two methods to install the runtime:

- Download the release or nightly build (easy)
- Build the file yourself (harder)

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> Nightly builds may be more unstable than releases and should probably only be
> used if you are instructed to do so in a bug report or you know exactly what
> using nightlies implies.

## Get up and running for 3DS

Download the `.cia` file or `.3dsx` in the Releases tab or

> [!NOTE]

> you can just download it there and keep it updated that way!

### .cia (Installable app)

Place the `.cia` file in the `cias/` folder of your 3DS SD card. Open the FBI
application and navigate to the `cias/` folder and install the `.cia` file.

Everywhere application on your Home screen.

# Installation

Scratch Everywhere! is Homebrew software and requires a hacked/modded console.
There are two methods to install the runtime:

- Download the release or nightly build (easy)
- Build the file yourself (harder)

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> Nightly builds may be more unstable than releases and should probably only be
> used if you are instructed to do so in a bug report or you know exactly what
> using nightlies implies.
